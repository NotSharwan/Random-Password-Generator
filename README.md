# Random-Password-Generator in Pyhton
It’s important to protect your personal information and the most common way we do this is with a password. So in this project, you’ll create a program to generate passwords for you.

The passwords will be random, so no one will be able to guess them!
===============================

Let's create a python file in any text editor and start coding!

Adding random characters First, let's import random. This will help us in getting a random number!

Next, we will create a list of alphabets,numbers,special symbols.

Now you can choose a random character from the lists, and store it in a variable called password.

Shuffle the password in a random order.

Finally, you can print your password to the screen.
